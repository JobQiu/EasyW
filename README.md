This is a little project aiming to improve the vocabulary quality when people are writing something, especially for GRE writing. There are several parts as follows:

##1. Translate Sentences

When I was preparing for the writing, I was always in trouble with sentences. For example, sometimes I will find it difficult to translate a sentence into English. So I have to search the examples of a word or resort to Google Translation. I hope to provide a place for people to talk about the difficult sentence they meet when they are writing. For convience, we will provide the google translation, and you can polish it. And we will also provide the vocabulary suggestion, which will be expatiated in Section 2 - Writing. 
People can raise problems as well.

##2. Writing

So far we just have several titles from the GRE official database, <font color="red">put the website here</font>. You can add some if you want. 
### Vocabulary Suggestion 
We will recomment some synonyms for you when you are writing or you have finished your articles. The synonyms are collected from `www.thesaurus.com/browse`, if you have some better website, please contact with me. Everytime you finish a sentence, we will search the database and website, then you can see the synonyms on the top of the page. Clicking some of them will change the content of your sentence, so that you can use better word in your article. In my opinion, if you can use these word more frequently, you will be familiar with them and improve your writing score. Also, your choice will be record to improve your own database and the total database( BTW, if you have some brilliant algorithms to learn these data to make the word recommend more precise, please contact with me :) ).
As to each article, we will figure out the word frequency and provide them on the right side of the page. Remove some if you think they are too easy, mark some if you want to memory them later and use them more in your own articles.
If you just want to write an article, you can choose another mode. That is we will make the suggestion after you finish your article. 
In section 5, you can choose some wonderful words, and we will send them to your email for you to memory them in a more scientific way.
In the end, you can choose some encouragement after each article, such as an English joke, some funny pictures, some inspiring sentences and maybe some a beautiful girl if you are recognized as a male and older then 18.
##3. RoundTable

This part is for some talks. When you've read some news from BBC or some answer on Quaro. Yon can launch some talks here. Exchange your opinion and also collect some materials for your writing.
##4. Chicken Blood（打鸡血）
Here, we can just collect some inspiring articles for you to encourage yourself, when you want to give up. Fighting, for your dream. 
##5. Word Regulation and Setting
You can manage the words you have marked or disliked. For those word you'd like to use more, we will search some relational sentences in Section 1. Then we will send the word and the sentence to your email everyday or every week.
In this part, you can also change your password, upload your icon etc.
##6. About the Website 

Here, you can make some suggestions, comments and donate me if possible(the money will only be used to support the server). 

Cheers, JobQ
